# Update Instructions Framework

## Overview

This prompt analyzes codebases and generates, updates, and maintains Copilot instruction files that guide AI coding agents. It implements a structured workflow to create a comprehensive instruction system for the PSModule ecosystem, ensuring consistent guidance across repositories while separating framework-level patterns from project-specific implementations.

## Specifications

### Target Architecture

The instruction system follows a two-tier hierarchy:

```
$InstructionsPath/
├── framework/                    # Generic, reusable patterns (automation-managed)
│   ├── main.instructions.md     # Universal cross-language guidelines
│   └── {Language}/              # Language-specific framework patterns
│       ├── main.instructions.md
│       ├── tests.instructions.md
│       └── classes.instructions.md
└── repo/                        # Project-specific patterns (manually curated)
    ├── main.instructions.md     # Repository context and rules
    └── {Language}/              # Project-specific language patterns
        └── main.instructions.md
```

**Path Variables** (resolved via `./scripts/Get-Paths.ps1`):
- `$RepositoryPath` - Root repository path
- `$InstructionsPath` - Instructions directory path (e.g., `$RepositoryPath/.github/prompts/framework`)
- `$FrameworkInstructionsPath` - Framework instructions directory path (e.g., `$InstructionsPath/framework`)
- `$RepositoryInstructionsPath` - Repository instructions directory path (e.g., `$InstructionsPath/repo`)

### Content Requirements

#### Framework Instructions (`$FrameworkInstructionsPath/`)

**Universal Cross-Language Guidelines** (`main.instructions.md`)
- General style guidelines applying across all programming languages
- Repository context: PSModule ecosystem patterns and structure
- PSModule build process integration and tooling
- Universal conventions: naming, file organization, documentation standards
- Consistency guidelines for all repository files

**Language-Specific Technical Guidelines** (`{Language}/main.instructions.md`)
- Language-specific style guidelines and best practices
- Syntax conventions, formatting rules, and idiomatic patterns
- Tooling integration: linters, formatters, build tools
- Code quality standards and technical patterns
- Error handling, logging, testing, and debugging approaches

#### Repository Instructions (`$RepositoryInstructionsPath/`)

**Project-Specific Context and Rules** (`main.instructions.md`)
- Repository purpose, scope, and deliverables
- Project-specific guidelines overriding/extending framework patterns
- Architecture, component relationships, and integration points
- Unique workflows, processes, and procedures
- Target audience, use cases, and business requirements

**Project-Specific Language Implementation** (`{Language}/main.instructions.md`)
- Language usage within this repository's specific context
- Project-specific patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions
- Integration patterns with other repository components
- Concrete examples demonstrating the repository's approach

#### Content Hierarchy and Precedence
1. **Framework instructions** provide foundation and universal patterns
2. **Repository instructions** override and extend framework instructions
3. **Language-specific instructions** inherit from their main instruction files
4. **Repository language instructions** take precedence over framework language instructions

### Quality Standards

#### File Format Requirements
```yaml
---
applyTo: <glob pattern for target files>
description: <succinct purpose in one sentence>
---
```
Content structure: Context lead, Goal, Execution steps, Behavior rules, Output format, Error handling, Definitions

#### Validation Criteria
- All instruction files must have proper YAML frontmatter
- `applyTo` patterns must correctly target intended file types
- Content completeness across all discovered languages/technologies
- Consistent terminology and patterns across instruction files
- Proper framework vs repository categorization

#### Success Metrics
- No content loss during migration or updates
- Complete technology coverage for discovered languages
- Proper separation of generic vs project-specific guidance
- All legacy instruction content successfully migrated

## Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites

1. **Path Resolution**: Execute [Gather.ps1](scripts/Gather.ps1) to establish required path variables
2. **Workspace Setup**: Ensure multiple repository scenario handling
3. **Backup Strategy**: Plan rollback procedures for failed migrations

### Execution Workflow

The implementation follows five distinct phases with clear gates between each:

#### Phase 1: Setup (T001)
- **Gate**: All paths resolved and validated
- Path resolution and workspace preparation

#### Phase 2: Analysis (T002-T003)
- **Gate**: Complete content inventory and categorization plan
- Discovery and content categorization planning

#### Phase 3: Creation (T004-T005)
- **Gate**: All instruction files created with proper structure
- Framework and repository instruction file creation

#### Phase 4: Migration (T006)
- **Gate**: All legacy content successfully migrated
- Content migration from legacy sources

#### Phase 5: Validation (T007-T009)
- **Gate**: System validated, cleaned up, and user feedback collected
- Quality validation, cleanup, and final verification

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Content categorization unclear
- **Solution**: Apply hierarchy: Generic patterns → framework, Project-specific patterns → repository

**Issue**: Legacy content migration incomplete
- **Solution**: Abort cleanup, verify all content accounted for, retry migration

**Issue**: Validation failures
- **Solution**: Check YAML frontmatter format, verify `applyTo` patterns, ensure content completeness

**Issue**: Path resolution fails
- **Solution**: Verify `./scripts/Get-Paths.ps1` exists and executes successfully

#### Recovery Procedures
- **Before T008**: All operations are additive, safe to retry individual tasks
- **During T008**: STOP if any validation fails - content loss risk
- **After T008**: Recovery requires manual restoration from version control

#### Abort Conditions
- Path resolution script unavailable or fails
- Critical content cannot be categorized (framework vs repository)
- Legacy content migration would result in data loss
- Validation reveals structural inconsistencies that cannot be resolved
